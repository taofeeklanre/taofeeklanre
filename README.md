## About Me

Hi there, my name is Taofeek Agboola ðŸ‘‹  
I am an accomplished DevOps Engineer with experience in deploying and managing infrastructure using HashiCorp Terraform and GitHub Actions. I have deep proficiency in AWS services, including CloudWatch, S3, Route 53, VPC, EC2, IAM Users & Roles, Lambda, and serverless architectures. My expertise spans across Docker and Linux, with significant hands-on experience in the implementation of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

Throughout my career, I have worked with various organizations on cloud migration projects, cloud cost optimization, and solutions architecture. I am a versatile, and skilled at designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible, and containerizing applications with a variety of tools and technologies. Additionally, I possess strong experience in system administration, networking, and cybersecurity, with proficiency in Python and Bash for scripting.

In addition to my technical acumen, I am well-versed in Agile methodologies, utilizing tools such as Jira for effective project management and task tracking. I recognize the importance of clear, structured documentation and leverage Confluence to document workflows, processes, and procedures, ensuring alignment and clarity across teams. This ensures that every team member understands the 'what,' 'how,' and 'when' of project deliverables.

My commitment to innovation and operational excellence ensures that I stay ahead in the ever-evolving DevOps landscape.
