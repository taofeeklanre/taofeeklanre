My expertise spans across Docker and Linux, with significant hands-on experience in the implementation of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

Throughout my career, I have worked with various organizations on cloud migration projects, cloud cost optimization, and solutions architecture. I am a versatile, and skilled at designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible, and containerizing applications with a variety of tools and technologies.
